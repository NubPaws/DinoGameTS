# Dino Game TS

## Playing the Game
You can run the game going to the [GitHub page](https://nubpaws.github.io/DinoGameTS/).<br/>
The GitHub page runs on a second branch that was made purposely for the the pages service.

You can also run the game locally on your machine with Docker by running the following in your command line terminal:
```bash
docker build -t dino-game . && docker run -it dino-game
```
The game will run on [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

## Motivation
This is a recreation of Google's Dino Game, the one that you can play when you don't have an internet connection. This game was made using TypeScript and Node.js.

If you want to play the original dino game for comparison, you can access it via [chrome://dino](chrome://dino) on a Google Chrome browser.
